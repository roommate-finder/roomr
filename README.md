# Roomr

Roomr is an apartment and roommate finding app, inspired by Tinder. Users can swipe on apartments that they like and get matched with other users who also liked those apartments. They can then start chats to get to know each other better, to potentially become roommates.

\*All apartment data is adapted from apartments.com

## Key Features
